# MessagePack

It's like JSON but fast and small. That is how MessagePack  is described by [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/). 
It has an easy setup and usage. Decoding for a single operation is faster than json about 1 ms. But it is good when we are working with microservices.
Redis, FluentD and Pinterest are the famous companies that use MessagePack.
